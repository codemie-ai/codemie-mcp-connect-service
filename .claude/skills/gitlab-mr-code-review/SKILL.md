   Reviews GitLab merge requests by fetching changes, analyzing code against

   "review MR", "check merge request", "code review", "review !123",
   or provides a GitLab MR URL.

# GitLab MR Code Review

Fetch MR changes → analyze using code review guidelines → get user approval → post inline comments to GitLab.

## Prerequisites

- `glab` CLI authenticated (`glab auth status`)
- Code review guidelines at `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`

## Configuration

**Default Project:** `epm-cdme/mermaid-server` (ID: 19214)

For other projects, specify `--repo <PROJECT>` in glab commands.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Extract MR ID

From user input:
- `!123` → `123`
- `https://gitbud.epam.com/epm-cdme/mermaid-server/-/merge_requests/123` → `123`

### Step 2: Fetch MR Data and Checkout Branch

```bash
# Get MR metadata
glab mr view <MR_ID> --repo epm-cdme/mermaid-server

# Get diff refs (required for inline comments)
glab api "projects/:id/merge_requests/<MR_ID>" --repo epm-cdme/mermaid-server | \
  jq '{base_sha: .diff_refs.base_sha, start_sha: .diff_refs.start_sha, head_sha: .diff_refs.head_sha}'

# Store SHAs for Step 5
```

**For large PRs:** Pull and checkout the branch locally:
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout <source_branch>
```

**Validation:**
- MR `merged`/`closed` → ask user if should continue
- Diff >5000 lines → warn user, focus on critical files

### Step 3: Review Code

1. **Read guidelines:** `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`
2. **For large diffs:** Read key changed files directly from checkout
3. **Analyze against project patterns:**
   - Security: secrets, input validation, dependency vulnerabilities
   - Dockerfile changes: layer ordering, ARG placement, unnecessary layers
   - Performance: image size, build cache efficiency

4. **Classify findings:**
   - **CRITICAL:** Security vulnerabilities, data corruption, crashes
   - **MAJOR:** Performance bottlenecks, missing error handling, broken build patterns

### Step 4: Format Comments for Approval

Present findings with position details:

```markdown
## Proposed Comments for MR !<ID>

### Critical Issues (<count>)

**[1]** 🚨 CRITICAL: <Title>
- **File:** `path/to/file`
- **Line:** 45 (new_line)

**Issue:** <description>
**Impact:** <what could go wrong>
**Fix:**
```
# corrected code
```

---

### Major Issues (<count>)

**[2]** ⚠️ MAJOR: <Title>
- **File:** `path/to/file`
- **Line:** 23 (new_line)

**Issue:** <description>
**Fix:** <solution>

---

**SHA References:**
- base_sha: `<sha>`
- start_sha: `<sha>`
- head_sha: `<sha>`
```

### Step 5: User Approval Gate ⚠️

**REQUIRED: Get explicit approval before posting.**

```
Found X critical and Y major issues. Choose action:
1. Approve all - Post all comments
2. Select specific - e.g., "1,3,5"
3. Edit - Modify before posting
4. Cancel - Don't post
```

**Default to Cancel if unclear.**

### Step 6: Post Inline Comments to GitLab

**IMPORTANT:** Inline comments can ONLY be placed on lines that appear in the diff (added/modified/deleted lines).

#### 6.1: Verify Line is in Diff

Before posting, confirm the target line is actually changed:
```bash
# Check if line appears in diff (look for the line content)
glab mr diff <MR_ID> --repo epm-cdme/mermaid-server | grep -A2 -B2 "the_code_on_that_line"
```

If the line isn't in the diff, you cannot post an inline comment there. Use a general MR comment instead.

#### 6.2: Post Inline Comment

For **added/modified lines** (lines with `+` in diff):
```bash
printf '%s' '{
  "body": "**🚨 CRITICAL: Issue Title**\n\nDescription of the issue.\n\n**Impact:** What could go wrong.\n\n**Fix:**\n```\n# Fixed code\n```",
  "position": {
    "position_type": "text",
    "base_sha": "<BASE_SHA>",
    "start_sha": "<START_SHA>",
    "head_sha": "<HEAD_SHA>",
    "old_path": "<FILE_PATH>",
    "new_path": "<FILE_PATH>",
    "new_line": <LINE_NUMBER>
  }
}' | glab api --method POST "projects/19214/merge_requests/<MR_ID>/discussions" --input - -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

For **deleted lines** (lines with `-` in diff):
```bash
printf '%s' '{
  "body": "Comment on deleted code",
  "position": {
    "position_type": "text",
    "base_sha": "<BASE_SHA>",
    "start_sha": "<START_SHA>",
    "head_sha": "<HEAD_SHA>",
    "old_path": "<FILE_PATH>",
    "new_path": "<FILE_PATH>",
    "old_line": <LINE_NUMBER>
  }
}' | glab api --method POST "projects/19214/merge_requests/<MR_ID>/discussions" --input - -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### 6.3: Fallback - General MR Note

If inline comment fails (line not in diff), post as general discussion:
```bash
printf '%s' '{
  "body": "**🚨 CRITICAL: Issue Title**\n\n**File:** `path/to/file` **Line:** 411\n\nDescription..."
}' | glab api --method POST "projects/19214/merge_requests/<MR_ID>/discussions" --input - -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Common Position Errors

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `line_code can't be blank` | Line not in diff | Verify line is actually changed; use general comment if not |
| `position is invalid` | Wrong SHA or missing field | Re-fetch diff_refs; ensure old_path + new_path both present |
| `new_line is invalid` | Line number doesn't exist | Check actual line numbers in the new file version |

### Step 7: Summary

```
✓ Posted X/Y comments to MR !<ID>
  - Critical: <count>
  - Major: <count>
  - Failed: <count> (if any)

View: https://gitbud.epam.com/epm-cdme/mermaid-server/-/merge_requests/<ID>
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `glab: command not found` | Install: `brew install glab` |
| `not authenticated` | Run `glab auth login` |
| `MR not found` | Verify ID: `glab mr list --repo epm-cdme/mermaid-server` |
| `HTTP 415` | Add `-H "Content-Type: application/json"` |
| `HTTP 400 position is invalid` | Verify SHAs and position fields match (new_line vs old_line) |
| Comment not inline | Ensure JSON has complete `position` object |

## Examples

**Standard review:**
```
User: "Review MR !42"
→ Fetch metadata + SHAs
→ glab mr diff 42 --repo epm-cdme/mermaid-server
→ Read .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md
→ Analyze: 1 critical, 2 major
→ Show proposals with file/line/position
→ User: "Approve all"
→ Post inline comments via glab api
→ Summary with MR URL
```

**Large MR:**
```
User: "Review !38" (20 files)
→ Warn: Large diff
→ git checkout source_branch
→ Read key files directly
→ Focus on Dockerfile, Makefile, CI config
→ Present findings → User approval → Post
```

**Selective posting:**
```
→ Find 5 issues [1]-[5]
→ User: "Post 1,3,5"
→ Post only selected comments
```
